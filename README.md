# Mobile Price Range Prediction 

## Project Intro/Objective
In the competitive mobile phone market companies want to understand sales data of mobile phones and factors which drive the prices. The objective is to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM,Internal Memory, etc) and its selling price. In this problem, we do not have to predict the actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is.

## Project Description
 
__Exploratory Data Analysis__
After loading the dataset we performed this method by comparing our target variable that is Price Range with other independent variables. This process helped us figuring out various aspects and relationships among the target and the independent variables. It gave us a better idea of which feature behaves in which manner compared to the target variable.

__Null values Treatment__
Our dataset does not containing any missing values ,so we can proceed futher into the analysis .
	
__Encoding of categorical columns__
One Hot Encoding produce binary integers of 0 and 1 to encode our categorical features because categorical features that are in string format cannot be understood by the machine and needs to be converted to numerical format. In our data set there is not categorical variable , so there is no need of encoding in our project.

__Model Selection__ 
For modelling we tried various classification algorithms like:
* Knn Classfier 
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest Classifier
__Model Evaluation__
Model evaluation is very important in data science. It helps you to understand the performance of your model and makes it easy to present your model to other people
We used confusion matrix for the evaluation.
